Okay, so *Final Destination 5* dropped, and yeah, you knew it was coming. Same core idea, just another round of Death playing catch-up.

It was pretty much what you expect from the series: a guy gets a whack preview of his own demise (which is always cool), saves a group of people he thinks are doomed (who are instantly freaked out), and then they gotta desperately try to outsmart the Grim Reaper.

The acting is fine, the jumps are kinda standard, and Death is stillâ€¦ well, Death. They really leaned into the supernatural dread, which mostly just makes you feel the dread. Didn't blow my mind, but it definitely kept me on edge most of the runtime. If you've seen the others, you know the ride, but it's still a wild ride.
