Okay, so I just watched 'Bring Her Back' and wow. Just... wow. The premise is pretty messed up from the start â€“ dad dies, new foster sister shows up, and *that's* the horrifying twist? It hits different, you know? The acting was solid, kept me engaged, but the real gut punch was how *real* it felt. Like, it could actually happen.

Definitely gave me that icky feeling that lingers long after the credits. Definitely not the kind of movie you watch right before bed, *unless* you want a nightmare fuel boost. Creepy stuff, man. Creepy.
