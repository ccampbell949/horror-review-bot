Okay, here’s a review for the dark vibes on 'Saint Catherine':

Stepping into Saint Catherine's felt like finding sanctuary... until the whispers started. 🙅‍♂️

That poor girl, rescued from unthinkable horrors, finds a 'safe' haven only to discover her worst fears aren't demons from the dark beyond the walls. They're the sins she's learning to master, the power burning just beneath her skin. 💨

Prepare for a chilling descent into the shadowed corners of salvation. The promise of the institute? It bites, literally and metaphorically. A must-watch for those craving something sinister. 👻
