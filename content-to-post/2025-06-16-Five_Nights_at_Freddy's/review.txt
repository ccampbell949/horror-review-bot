Okay, so I watched the first *Five Nights at Freddy's* movie. It was okay, I guess. The premise is pretty creepy: total loser Mike gets hired to guard an abandoned pizzeria full of animatronics, and bad things happen. There are definitely some cool moments and good jump scares, especially with those creepy old games. The atmosphere is mostly tense, which is good for a horror flick. But honestly, it feels a bit like it's trying too hard sometimes, you know? Like it's leaning so hard into the FNAF vibe, it forgets to be subtle, which is fine for some parts, but it gets a bit repetitive. Jake Epstein as Mike sells the character, which helps. The ending had a bit of a twist that was kinda predictable, but still got me. Definitely not a masterpiece, but it does what it sets out to do â€“ give you a spooky night in. There's definitely a fun energy to it.
