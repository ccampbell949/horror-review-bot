Okay, so 'The Haunting at Saint Joseph's'? Pointed my girlfriend and her buddies towards that last weekend, honestly didn't think it'd be *that* intense.

Turns out, it totally was. Starts out fine, just a group of friends chilling at this old guesthouse. But dude, the vibes from the jump felt kinda wrong. And then the stuff started happening.

Not jump scares, mostly. Just weird behavior, escalating, with these strong emotions boiling over. Anger you don't recognize, paranoia building fast, someone getting really aggressive. It kept me on edge the whole time, especially the twist about the old sacrifice. Made it feel deeper, more personal somehow.

Solid cast, believable acting for the most part. The ending felt a bit rushed, but I get it, it was meant to be unsettling. Definitely gave me those cold chills.

If you're into modern horror that plays with your head, definitely give this a watch. It'll mess with you for a bit. ðŸ‘»
