Okay, here's a review for *Rosario*:

Just spent a few hours in Rosario's world. Apartment #6B has a history, secrets buried deep.

Rosario Fuentes comes back, the stockbroker, loss still raw. Tries to sort her grandmother's things. Just quiet stuff, right? Wrong.

A hidden chamber. Filled with... *things*. Whispers on the wind. Objects that scream ritual. Dark choices given shape.

Now, things stir when she sleeps. Cold spots mark her path. The past isn't staying buried. It wants out.

She's got to confront the shadows *and* the people who cast them. Family secrets are heavy bricks. Sacrifices demand knowledge.

Fighting the supernatural? Secondary to the fight against what she might be. The sins of the ancestors tainting her blood.

Gripping stuff. Terrifying and intimate. Wondering what *really* lies beneath Rosario's surface and the apartment's secrets. Definitely unsettling.
