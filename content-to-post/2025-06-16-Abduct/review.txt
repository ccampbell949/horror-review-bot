Okay, settle in, turn down the lights... 🌙

**Movie:** Abduct
**Rating:** 4.5/5 🌟🌟🌟🌟☆

**Spotted a film that taps into pure nightmare fuel?**

It started idyllic: Sarah's escape to the remote mountain cabin 🏡. But the peace shattered when Michael...vanished. 🙀

Just as despair crept in, a stranger appeared at her door, naked and claiming to be Michael. 😨 But is he the lost love, or something *far* stranger? 👻

**Abduct** masterfully creeps you out. It plays like a fever dream, focusing on Sarah's descent into paranoia and the unsettling ambiguity of reality. You'll find yourself questioning everything, just like her. 🤯

The film keeps you guessing right until the final unsettling beat. It’s a haunting trip into identity and fear. Is he Michael? Or is he... something else entirely? 🧛‍♂️

**A must-watch for horror fans craving psychological dread and shocking twists.**

Is your spine tingling yet? Goosebumps guaranteed! 🫣
