ugh, saw this tonight. It hit pretty close to home honestly. The premise is fine, but honestly felt like a forgettable ghost story. Julie is clearly haunted by what happened last summer (haunted in more than one way lol), goes on vacation for the weirdest reason, and someone totally *gets* what happened and is totally not letting it go. It all builds to a finale that wasn't *that* shocking, but definitely gave me that whew feeling. Not bad for a summer night though, I guess. ðŸ˜± 3/5 stars.
