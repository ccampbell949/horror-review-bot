Okay, here's a short, stylistic review for "Heart Eyes":

**Heart Eyes: Valentine's Just Got Fatal.**

Seattle is supposed to be sweet. Turns out, it’s terrifying. This flick nails the dread of Valentine's Day, turning romance into a frantic scramble for your life. One killer, no name, just the chilling signature: hunting couples. Two co-workers, caught up in overtime on a fateful Tuesday, become the target instead of *them*. Expect the expected: cheap suits, a lurking silhouette, heart-shaped blood splatters. The real horror? Realizing the worst of the holidays: being alone, even if you’re not. Just remember to run fast and scream loud.
