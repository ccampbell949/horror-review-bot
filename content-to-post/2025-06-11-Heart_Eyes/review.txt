Okay, buckle up, because this one just gave me chills. 🎥

**Movie: Heart Eyes (2024)**
**Rating: INSTAGRAM SPOOKY 5/5**

Seattle isn't exactly known for its love life... much. But on Valentine's Day? Expect the unexpected.

Two co-workers, stuck pulling overtime on arguably the most cliché day for romance, stumble into pure nightmare fuel. 🤦‍♀️

Enter the "Heart Eyes Killer." Or rather, *The* Killer. Hunting couples. Using their *own* hearts against them. It's a horror twist on the classic stalk-and-slash, but with *so* much style. 👀👁️

Needless to say, mistaken identity is a bad look when said killer is watching through binoculars. 🕵️♂️🔪

Running through Seattle on a freezing Valentine's night? Perfect setting. Perfect terror. This film is pure adrenaline-pumped, heart-racing thriller. 🔥

You've GOT to see this one. Trust me, or trust the killer's eyes.

Go watch. 🎬💨 ...and maybe bring someone with you? Just kidding, RUN!
